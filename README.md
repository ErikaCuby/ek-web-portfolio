# 🌪️ Erika's Web Portfolio (aka ErikaOS™)

Welcome to my personal portfolio — the project that started as a “quick weekend build” and became a multi-week odyssey of self-reflection, pixel perfectionism, and approximately 73 discarded layout ideas.

This site is where I, Erika Cuby, attempt to combine my two creative alter egos:

- 👩‍💻 **Developer Erika** — who swears at margins and believes in semantic HTML  
- 🎨 **Illustrator Erika** — who draws soft lines and dramatic feelings with zero regard for screen constraints

They don’t always get along. But they live here now. Together. Under one React-powered roof.

## 🎭 Dual Personality Disorder, But Make It A Website

This portfolio is split into two delicious sections:

### 👩‍💻 Developer World
> “Why yes, I *do* obsessively fine-tune component structure, thanks for asking.”

- Showcases front-end projects
- Built with React + Vite
- Styled by hand like a proper millennial
- Projects open into full-blown case studies because yes, I have things to say

### 🎨 Illustrator World (Coming Soon™)
> “Colors. Feelings. Grid who?”

- A gallery of emotional pixels and visual vibes
- Will also have case studies, because the drama behind a single brush stroke is *real*

## 🛠️ Stack (inspired by tears and trial & error)

- **React** (because obviously)
- **React Router** (to go places)
- **Custom CSS Modules** (Tailwind? Never heard of her)
- **variables.css** — where all the magic lives
- **index.css** — shared components, shared trauma
- **JSON files** — because hardcoding is for the weak
